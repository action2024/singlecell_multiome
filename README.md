- Stemness: Linc-ROR maintains the pluripotency state of hESCs by sequestering miR-145 and releasing its negative regulation from NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 mRNAs. 
- Endoderm: The decrease of SOX2 levels, whose expression correlates first with stemness and then with ectoderm specification, represents a key step to proceed toward the endoderm direction, unlocking the expression of EOMES first and FOXA2 and SOX17 later as specific markers for the DE
- Endoderm: SMAD3 signaling pathway is at the core of endoderm commitment: DIGIT lncRNA is induced by TGF-β family signaling, regulates GSG to control endoderm commitment. LINC00261 regulates hESC differentiation to the endoderm and pancreatic cell lineage. Its expression correlate to its neighboring gene FOXA2, and its depletion abolishes the potency of endoderm differentiation in hESCs.
- Pancreas differentiation: The lncRNA LINC00261 (DEANR1) controls the establishment of insulin-positive cells. Deleting LINC00261 significantly reduced the formation of insulin-producing cells during differentiation.
- Mesoderm: yylncT loss resulted in strong inhibition of BRACHYURY (T) and of early mesodermal gene expression upon mesoderm induction, while differentiation toward ectoderm or endoderm was unaffected.
- Muscle: The mechanism of action of linc-YY1 by which it promotes muscle differentiation is mediated by its binding on the promoter of its neighboring gene YY1, thus destabilizing its association with PRC2.
